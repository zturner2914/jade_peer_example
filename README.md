# Jade_Memes

This application uses the MEAN stack with a Jade template.

It sends an Express GET response with a JSON payload that is passed to the Jade template to render six images.  Default captions for each image are retrieved using an Angular HTTP call, and are editable and automatically updated using an Angular controller.
